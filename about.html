        <h1>ABOUT CRISTIANO RONALDO</h1>
        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the greatest footballers of all time, known for his incredible
             goal-scoring ability, athleticism, and versatility on the field. He began his professional career with Sporting CP before moving to Manchester United in 2003,
              where he gained global recognition, winning three Premier League titles and a UEFA Champions League title.
        In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then-world record transfer fee. At Real Madrid , he became the club's all-time leading scorer
         and won numerous trophies, including four UEFA Champions League titles. He then moved to Juventus in 2018, continuing to add to his goal tally 
         and winning two Serie A titles. In 2021, he returned to Manchester United before moving to Al Nassr in 2023. Ronaldo has also had a stellar
          international career with Portugal, winning the UEFA European Championship in 2016 and the UEFA Nations League in 2019.</p>
